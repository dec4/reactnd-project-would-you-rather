# Would You Rather Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data. The only thing you need to edit in the ` _DATA.js` file is the value of `avatarURL`. Each user should have an avatar, so you’ll need to add the path to each user’s avatar.

Using the provided starter code, you'll build a React/Redux front end for the application. We recommend using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## Getting Started
Note that this app was tested with node v14.19.3 (npm v6.14.17)

1. (optional) install and use nvm to set your node version: `nvm install && nvm use`
1. install all project dependencies: `npm install`
1. start the development server: `npm start`

### Using my backend client: (TODO: LINK)

> **_In Progress:_** Instead of using the provided fake database api, I am working on my own backend database manager. This was created using FastAPI, therefore we can use [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation) to create the frontend client.

Prerequisites:

1. install [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation) (I used `brew install openapi-generator`)
1. **(important)** run the backend service locally following the README instructions. When the main service is running, the openapi specifications should be hosted on http://localhost:8008/openapi.json.

To regenerate the client, run `npm run generate-be-client`

### Todos (note to self)

* adhere to rubric (review specifications)
* handle failed api updates
    * new question: store form and alert if failed
* redirect to appropriate places
    * on new question submit --> open questions/:qid ?
    * on answer submit --> open questions/:qid ?
    * store `showAnswered` for returning back to dashboard page
    * fix double login load (shows error)
* general style

# Original Notes / Instructions:

## Data
